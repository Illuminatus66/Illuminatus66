## About Me
I'm passionate about coding and creating innovative products and services. My skills and tech stack are diverse, allowing me to tackle a wide range of projects. Here's a bit about what I bring to the table:

## Skills

| Skill                                     | Description                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Versatile Frontend Development**        | I have the ability to quickly adapt to any JavaScript, TypeScript, or Python-based templating engine or frontend framework. This adaptability enables me to create dynamic and user-friendly interfaces. Currently, my personal favorite is ![Svelte Icon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Svelte-%23ff3e00?style=for-the-badge&logo=svelte&logoColor=white) because the DX is really smooth. |
| **Backend Expertise**                     | I'm proficient in a wide spectrum of backend frameworks, ranging from some of the oldest to the newest ones. This extensive knowledge allows me to build robust and efficient server-side solutions for various applications. My favorite in this case has to be ![Node.js Icon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-%23339933?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white) but recently I have been benchmarking ![Bun.js Icon](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bun.js-%232d2d2d?style=for-the-badge&logo=bun) against competitors simply because it's my dream to create a blazingly fast CI/CD platform in my lifetime. |
| **Computer Vision Enthusiast**            | While I'm at a beginner level in computer vision, I'm excited to explore its applications. I believe that computer vision has the potential to revolutionize industries, and I'm eager to be a part of that journey. For my final year project, a few of us are looking to create a video-chat app using ![React Native Icon](https://img.shields.io/badge/React%20Native-%2320232a?style=for-the-badge&logo=react), ![WebRTC Icon](https://img.shields.io/badge/WebRTC-%23FF5722?style=for-the-badge&logo=webrtc&logoColor=black) and ![OpenCV Icon](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenCV-%233776ab?style=for-the-badge&logo=opencv) which will convert ASL to text in real time. |
| **Multimedia Analysis**                   | I possess skills in audio, video, and image analysis. This skill enables me to work with multimedia data, opening doors to creative and data-driven projects. I am also interested in motion estimation and dehazing algorithms and continuously read up on the newest developments. |
| **Diverse Interests**                     | Currently, I'm diving into the worlds of game engines and network, system, and data security protocols. These domains present exciting challenges and opportunities for innovation. |
